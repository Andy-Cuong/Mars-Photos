- Network API acts as a data source
- Repository then gathers different data sources, perform business logic, resovles any conflicts,
	then acts as a single source of truth for the application
- It is better for repositories and ViewModel to be loosely coupled, so use dependency injection
	with repositories as dependencies
- All dependencies can be contained in an application container, so put the repositories inside 
	that (dependency) container
- viewModel() constructor cannot take arguments, so use ViewModel Factory to extract a customed
	application class which stores the (dependency) container. That container can be used to extract
	the dependency repository which can now be passed to the ViewModel Factory initializer
